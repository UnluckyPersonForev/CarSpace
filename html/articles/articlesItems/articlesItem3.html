                <p class="articles-item__paragraph articles-item__text">
                    Since the automatic transmission became a favorite of car
                    manufacturers and is installed in most modern cars, this
                    component has made driving much more convenient. Despite the
                    wide variety of transmission types, the classic automatic
                    transmission remains one of the most reliable. However, it
                    is also prone to failure for various reasons. Gearbox jerks
                    are one of the most common symptoms of failure. There are
                    many reasons for jerks to occur. Why does the gearbox jerk
                    and how to fix it, we will discuss in this article.

                <p class="articles-item__paragraph articles-item__text">
                    Car drivers may encounter such a problem as a delay in
                    shifting gears when moving from one gear to another.
                    Sometimes, when shifting, the car begins to jerk noticeably.
                    In automotive slang, such jerking is called jerks, jolts, or
                    bumps.

                    For novice drivers, it can be difficult to identify
                    transmission jerks, and they confuse them with engine
                    problems. However, experienced drivers distinguish jerks by
                    several categories:

                    <li class="articles-item__list-item">
                        during driving, there are jerks similar to hitting a
                        bumper, after which the car suddenly accelerates
                        forward;

                    Gearbox jerks seriously affect comfort or may become a
                    symptom of complete car failure. In practice, jerks are
                    noticeable in the following situations:
                </p>
                <ul class="articles-item__list">

                        while driving, when shifting to a higher or lower gear,
                        jerks are felt in the rear bumper, after which the car
                        suddenly moves forward;

                        when moving the selector from P to D or other modes, a

                <p class="articles-item__paragraph articles-item__text">
                    There are many possible causes of jerks. They may appear
                    only when the transmission is hot or cold. In any case, it
                    is important not to delay addressing this issue and to
                    consult a professional at a service center for diagnostics.

                <p class="articles-item__paragraph articles-item__text">
                    Only an experienced specialist can pinpoint the exact cause
                    of the jerks. It’s worth mentioning that there are many
                    components whose failure could cause jerks. Let's take a
                    closer look at them.

                </h2>
                <p class="articles-item__paragraph articles-item__text">
                    Severe wear on the engine and transmission mounts creates
                    noticeable jolts when shifting into forward or reverse
                    gears. Therefore, when transitioning from the neutral
                    position to drive with the car stationary, if a jerk is
                    felt, it is essential to first check the condition of the
                    engine and transmission mounts.

                <h2 class="articles-item__sub-header">Engine sensors</h2>
                <p class="articles-item__paragraph articles-item__text">
                    Jerks may be caused by faulty engine control sensors. For
                    instance, the mass air flow sensor or throttle position
                    sensor may be the cause of the jerks. Even the Check Engine
                    light may not turn on, and the error may not be recorded in
                    the system. If an error is recorded, it may not correspond
                    to the actual issue—everything could be fine with the parts
                    of the transmission that the error refers to.

                    Issues with the ECU are a common cause of jerks. In this
                    case, the transmission may jerk during braking or starting,
                    or at any other time. An electronic diagnostic check of the
                    ECU should be performed or the car’s ECU should be swapped
                    for a known working unit to check the system.

                    When performing major repairs on certain transmission

                    Jerks may occur due to a malfunction in the hydraulic valve

                    hydraulic block caused by overheating of the transmission.
                    This leads to a drop in oil pressure, which in turn causes

                    The transmission system is very sensitive to temperature.
                    Therefore, a functioning radiator and optimal temperature
                    control are crucial for stable operation. If the oil becomes
                    overheated, jerks will soon follow.

                <h2 class="articles-item__sub-header">Oil issues</h2>
                <p class="articles-item__paragraph articles-item__text">
                    This issue is considered the most common, and we will
                    discuss it in detail. Transmission fluid is a vital element
                    in the operation of the automatic transmission. It is the
                    key working fluid in the transmission because, unlike manual
                    transmissions, the automatic transmission does not have a
                    direct mechanical connection to the engine, and the fluid
                    serves as the link in the torque converter responsible for
                    engagement. Therefore, when jerks or bumps occur, the first
                    thing the technician will do is check the oil. Any deviation
                    in its quantity or quality can lead to jerking.
                </p>
                <p class="articles-item__paragraph articles-item__text">
                    The oil operates under high temperatures, and over time, it
                    loses its valuable properties due to this. As a result, it
                    becomes ineffective at transmitting torque from the engine
                    to the transmission, becoming either too thick or too thin.
                    The result is jerks or bumps. This is why it is crucial to
                    change the transmission fluid on time, as we previously
                    discussed in this article.
                </p>
                <p class="articles-item__paragraph articles-item__text">
                    When changing the fluid, the oil filter should also be
                    replaced, as it gets clogged over time and no longer allows
                    oil to pass through in the proper quantity. This can cause
                    transmission issues and jerks when shifting gears.
                </p>
                <p class="articles-item__paragraph articles-item__text">
                    It is very important to use the correct amount of oil when
                    replacing it and to use only the transmission fluid
                    recommended by the manufacturer. Sometimes, certain brands
                    of oil recommended by the car manufacturer may be difficult
                    or impossible to find in Ukraine. In such cases, a
                    high-quality universal oil suitable for your transmission
                    should be chosen. Using unsuitable or low-quality oil can
                    lead to serious failures, and jerks or bumps will become
                    just a minor issue.

                    Many car owners often complain that they feel bumps when the

                    does not provide maximum efficiency. If the problem persists
