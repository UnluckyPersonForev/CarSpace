                    For those planning to buy a car, the task is not easy. The
                    huge variety of makes and models in different price ranges
                    can be overwhelming. Especially if the future car owner is
                    not familiar with the technology. The choice of car depends
                    on the budget and preferences. But the main selection
                    criterion is often the type of transmission. Nowadays, cars
                    are produced with different types of transmissions. Each of
                    them has its advantages and disadvantages, operating
                    features, and maintenance costs. So, what should you choose?
                    This is what our article is about.

                <p class="articles-item__paragraph articles-item__text">
                    First, let's clarify that you shouldn't choose a car solely
                    based on the type of gearbox. At the very least, because
                    every driver has their own preferences and opinions. It's
                    also worth noting that every manufacturer, in their history
                    of producing cars, has had “flaws,” releasing gearboxes with
                    errors and shortcomings. We're not talking about Chinese
                    cars. Brands like Toyota, Mitsubishi, and Volkswagen have
                    been found with notable issues.
                </p>
                <p class="articles-item__paragraph articles-item__text">
                    Therefore, the choice of gearbox should be based on
                    rationality. It's necessary to gather detailed information
                    about the specific model and type of gearbox. For example,
                    what are the most common failures with this gearbox, whether
                    there are problems right from the factory, what potential
                    defects exist, and if there are any weak spots. Collecting
                    this detailed information will help you choose the most
                    optimal option based on driving experience and other
                    subjective factors.
                </p>
                <p class="articles-item__paragraph articles-item__text">
                    Also, don't forget that nowadays, with fierce competition
                    between automakers, everyone is trying to pull the blanket
                    towards themselves. For example, the VAG group, which
                    produces cars under the Audi, Volkswagen, and Škoda brands,
                    started installing their version of the gearbox called DSG.
                    In fact, DSG is just a regular robot with dual clutches. But
                    the new name distinguishes the manufacturer and confuses the
                    buyer. However, this gearbox has its own advantages and
                    features. It consists of two units. One of them is
                    responsible for 1st, 3rd, and 5th gears, while the other is
                    responsible for 2nd, 4th, and 6th. The operation is fully
                    automatic, with high-quality electronics involved.
                    Therefore, the driver does nothing. When the gearbox shifts
                    to 2nd gear, the next step is the automatic shift to 3rd
                    gear. It is in standby mode and shifts automatically from
                    2nd to 3rd. And it does so in milliseconds. The driver
                    doesn't even notice it. Acceleration is smooth and pleasant.
                    There are no jolts or jerks. This type of gearbox is ideal
                    for those who enjoy agile, fast driving.

                <p class="articles-item__paragraph articles-item__text">
                    There is also another type of gearbox called Powershift.
                    These are installed in Ford vehicles. The Powershift gearbox
                    operates similarly to DSG. The difference lies in the
                    software and settings. The similarity between the two types
                    of gearboxes is not only in the operating principle but also
                    in the components. Their quantity and types are practically
                    the same, but they are produced by different manufacturers.

                <p class="articles-item__paragraph articles-item__text">
                    In the end, all the existing types of gearboxes can be
                    divided into four types:

                    Worldwide, the lion's share of car sales is accounted for by
                    manual transmissions. In some countries, most cars are
                    produced only with manual gearboxes. In the CIS countries,
                    where a wide range of cars with different types of

                    For every car enthusiast, their first car was likely a
                    manual transmission, and it's the type they learned to drive
                    on. Many are convinced that a manual is durable,

                    The issue is that there is a wide range of manual gearboxes,
                    many of which have more drawbacks than even the most
                    unreliable automatics. Therefore, when choosing an MT, you
                    need to consider the manufacturer and its reputation.
                    However, even then, there is always the risk of buying a car
                    with an unreliable MT.

                    So, which gearbox should you choose?
                </h2>
                <p class="articles-item__paragraph articles-item__text">
                    We can't definitively nominate a winner for the "best
                    gearbox" award. Every car enthusiast has their own criteria
                    for selection. If practicality, reliability, and long-term
                    operation are important, then manual transmission is
                    unbeaten. If comfort is the priority – choose an automatic
                    transmission based on a torque converter. CVTs are slowly
                    becoming a serious competitor to both manual and automatic
                    transmissions, offering incredible dynamics, smoothness, and
                    driving pleasure. However, manufacturers still can't extend
                    the lifespan of this gearbox. The robotized gearbox provides
                    maximum driving comfort and is truly smart and adapted to
                    all conditions. But it remains the least reliable.
