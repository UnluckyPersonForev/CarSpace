                    Signs of Automatic Transmission Failure
                </h1>
                <p class="articles-item__paragraph articles-item__text">
                    The automatic transmission is one of the most important
                    components in a car's system. During operation, it is
                    subjected to heavy loads: driving style and duration,
                    overheating, temperature fluctuations, and more. The
                    combination of these loads with the natural wear of
                    transmission parts, untimely maintenance, and failure to
                    follow operating guidelines leads to breakdowns. Every car
                    owner knows that repairing an automatic transmission is a
                    costly process. Therefore, to avoid serious malfunctions or
                    prevent their progression, it is important to recognize the
                    signs of transmission failure in time. Once the component is
                    determined to be faulty, timely intervention and repair are
                    required. In this article, we will explain in detail how to
                    identify the signs of a CVT or automatic transmission
                    failure, what causes these issues, and how to localize the
                    failures.

                    Even a beginner car owner can identify if the transmission
                    is malfunctioning. Typically, any malfunction will manifest
                    in unusual behavior of the automatic transmission:

                    If one occurs, sooner or later, the driver will definitely
                    feel it. The car immediately begins to behave improperly:
                    from loss of performance to complete failure to move.
                    Recognizing a malfunction in the transmission is easy, but
                    understanding the exact cause and which specific part is

                    Common Automatic Transmission Failures
                </h2>
                <p class="articles-item__paragraph articles-item__text">
                    The automatic transmission consists of many parts. It is a
                    complex system that is prone to failure due to improper
                    operation of even the smallest part. However, we will focus
                    on the most common types and causes of automatic
                    transmission failures.
                </p>
                <h2 class="articles-item__sub-header">Transmission Fluid</h2>
                <p class="articles-item__paragraph articles-item__text">
                    Oil plays a crucial role in the operation of the automatic
                    transmission. Transmission fluid (ATF) forms a film and
                    lubricates moving parts. It is the foundation of the torque
                    converter, which provides engagement, applies pressure to
                    the friction plates, causing gear shifts. It also helps to
                    dissipate the heat generated by the friction plates during
                    operation. Therefore, it is essential to monitor both the
                    quality and quantity of the oil. Unfortunately, not every
                    car owner timely takes the car to specialized service
                    centers, which can lead to breakdowns caused by the
                    transmission fluid.

                <h2 class="articles-item__sub-header">ATF Condition</h2>
                <p class="articles-item__paragraph articles-item__text">
                    Over time, the oil deteriorates and loses its chemical and
                    physical properties. The film it creates becomes thinner,
                    and eventually, it stops forming altogether. Due to
                    friction, without lubrication, metallic shavings form and
                    enter the fluid. As the fluid circulates through the system,
                    the shavings spread to other parts of the unit, causing
                    damage. To prevent this, it is necessary to regularly check
                    the condition of the oil, its color, consistency, presence
                    of shavings, and smell. This can be done manually with a
                    dipstick or by visiting a workshop. It is also important to
                    remember that the automatic transmission fluid should be
                    replaced at regular intervals. The replacement period
                    depends on several factors: the age of the car, mileage,
                    frequency of use, and driving style. The replacement
                    interval is specified in the manufacturer’s technical
                    manual.

                <h2 class="articles-item__sub-header">Low Oil Level</h2>
                <p class="articles-item__paragraph articles-item__text">
                    For the automatic transmission to operate correctly, the oil
                    must be at the appropriate level. It can be checked using a
                    dipstick (with appropriate marks on it). If the oil level is
                    low, and the car continues to be used without refilling, it
                    will lead to a transmission failure. The failure will
                    manifest as slipping, shaking, overheating, or the complete
                    stop of the vehicle. The oil level should be topped up to
                    avoid these issues. This may also indicate a leak.

                <p class="articles-item__paragraph articles-item__text">
                    A leak is easy to spot—it either appears as an oil puddle
                    under the car or oil in the oil pan. Leaks occur due to gaps
                    forming somewhere in the system: in the connection points of
                    pipes, electronics, or the casing. Usually, the problem is
                    resolved by replacing the faulty part. If a leak is noticed,
                    it should be fixed immediately, or it will cause issues due
                    to a lack of ATF.

                <p class="articles-item__paragraph articles-item__text">
                    In most cases, overheating of the automatic transmission is
                    related to insufficient oil, poor oil quality, or improper
                    oil condition. Less frequently, it is due to a malfunction
                    in the cooling system. Overheating can also occur due to
                    excessive vehicle use under certain conditions, which
                    prevents the cooling system from doing its job. In any case,
                    overheated oil will lead to catastrophic consequences, as it
                    interacts with critical transmission components. Overheating
                    negatively affects each of these parts, and hot oil can melt
                    plastic and damage components. To prevent this, it is
                    important to constantly monitor the condition of the
                    radiator and the sensor readings that track the temperature
                    in the transmission system. Temperatures above 100 degrees
                    Celsius are critical and require immediate attention from
                    specialists.

                <p class="articles-item__paragraph articles-item__text">
                    The torque converter (also known as the "bubbler") is
                    responsible for coupling and smooth gear shifting. It
                    separates the engine from the transmission and then
                    transfers torque, ensuring smooth gear transitions. When the
                    torque converter fails, gear shifts may become sticky,
                    sluggish, or the gears may completely disengage.
                    Fortunately, the torque converter can be repaired, and its
                    restoration will be significantly cheaper than replacing
                    other key transmission components.

                    entire system, manages gear shifting, and is one of the most
                    important components of the automatic transmission. During
                    vehicle operation, the hydraulic block is subjected to
                    immense stress. As a result, improper maintenance, poor oil
                    quality, and incorrect car usage often lead to its failure.
                    In practice, most hydraulic block failures occur due to the
                    car owner's negligence. For example, driving with cold oil
                    or skimping on maintenance will inevitably lead to problems.
                    Hydraulic block repairs are complex and expensive, so it is
                    often more practical and cost-effective to replace it
                    entirely.

                    least 2-4 minutes should be spent warming up the vehicle if
                    it has been standing in temperatures between -5 and -15°C.
                    If the temperature is lower, the warm-up should take at
                    least 10 minutes. It is not recommended to start abruptly
                    (full throttle), and you should avoid pressing both the gas
                    and brake pedals simultaneously. For small stops (e.g., at
