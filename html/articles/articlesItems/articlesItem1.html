                    Can You Extend It?
                </h1>
                <p class="articles-item__paragraph articles-item__text">
                    The legendary automatic transmission continues to stir
                    debate. Some claim it's an unreliable mechanism and opt for
                    manual, while others are convinced otherwise. The truth is,
                    not all automatics are created equal. Some automatic
                    transmissions fail after just 50,000 kilometers and need a
                    full rebuild, while others last 500,000 kilometers without
                    issues. The lifespan of an automatic depends on many
                    factors—from build quality to driving habits. In this
                    article, we’ll look into the real service life of an
                    automatic transmission, how to extend it, and what steps to
                    take.

                    Transmissions?
                </h2>
                <p class="articles-item__paragraph articles-item__text">
                    First of all, an automatic transmission is a mechanical
                    system. Like any mechanism that operates under daily stress,
                    it requires proper care and maintenance. You must regularly
                    monitor its condition, perform routine servicing, change the
                    fluid, check the filter and cooler, and run diagnostics.
                    With proper care, your transmission will last its full
                    lifespan—and potentially longer.
                </p>

                <p class="articles-item__paragraph articles-item__text">
                    Transmission manufacturers provide guidelines for fluid
                    replacement intervals and the type of transmission fluid to
                    use. However, real-world conditions, especially in our
                    region, are often harsher than those considered in European
                    or Asian recommendations. Still, it’s important to follow
                    these guidelines, including:

                        warming up the transmission for at least a few minutes
                        before driving.

                </ul>
                <p class="articles-item__paragraph articles-item__text">
                    Your local mechanic will advise you on how often to change
                    the fluid. It depends on the type and age of the
                    transmission. Usually, the interval is between 30,000–60,000
                    kilometers.

                <p class="articles-item__paragraph articles-item__text">
                    Some transmissions require fluid changes less often—every
                    70,000–100,000 kilometers. It all depends on build quality.
                    The market offers both budget and high-end options. So
                    before buying a car with an automatic, it’s wise to research
                    the transmission model, read reviews, or consult a
                    specialist.

                    The Reality of Automatic Transmission Lifespans
                </h2>
                <p class="articles-item__paragraph articles-item__text">
                    It's impossible to state a fixed lifespan for all
                    automatics. There are several reasons for this. First, many
                    people lump all types of transmissions together—automatic,
                    CVT, and dual-clutch—when in fact, they're quite different
                    in design and longevity.
                </p>
                <p class="articles-item__paragraph articles-item__text">
                    Even comparing two automatics, their lifespans may vary.
                    Factors like service quality, driving habits, and
                    transmission build play a big role. A high-end transmission
                    in a luxury vehicle that gets serviced annually and is
                    driven gently will last much longer than a cheap model used
                    as a taxi, especially if the owner never changes the fluid.

                    Durability and Longevity of Classic Automatics
                </h2>
                <p class="articles-item__paragraph articles-item__text">
                    In the past, automatic transmissions were far from ideal.
                    Manual gearboxes were truly the champions of durability. But
                    today, automatics have evolved significantly—lasting up to
                    500,000 kilometers or more with proper maintenance.

                <p class="articles-item__paragraph articles-item__text">
                    Again, usage style matters. Two identical cars with the same
                    transmission may have drastically different lifespans
                    depending on how they are driven and maintained.
                </p>
                <p class="articles-item__paragraph articles-item__text">
                    Classic automatic transmissions are considered the most
                    reliable compared to their newer counterparts. They’re
                    simpler in design, easier to service, and affordable to
                    repair. So if you're looking for long-term reliability, a
                    classic automatic is a solid choice.

                <p class="articles-item__paragraph articles-item__text">
                    CVTs are the second most reliable transmission type after
                    classic automatics, but they have more issues in our region.

                <p class="articles-item__paragraph articles-item__text">
                    CVTs use a fundamentally different design. They operate via
                    two pulleys connected by a metal belt and include a torque
                    converter. The belt wears down over time, producing metal
                    shavings and reducing the lifespan. Most CVTs need
                    replacement around 90,000–100,000 kilometers. Some modern
                    versions last 100,000–150,000 kilometers. Still, belt

                    Of all transmission types, the DCT is considered the least
                    reliable, with a lifespan of no more than 200,000
                    kilometers. Why so little? Because issues often arise with
                    actuators, clutch disks, or software.

                <p class="articles-item__paragraph articles-item__text">
                    While a DCT is essentially a manual gearbox with electronic
                    controls, the inclusion of servos and extra clutch
                    mechanisms adds complexity. This has led to the development
                    of two main types of DCTs.

                    Automated manual transmissions (ATM) combine servo drives
                    and actuators to handle clutch and gear changes. Servos are
                    a weak spot because they rely on input from temperature,
                    speed, and engine RPM sensors—and this coordination isn’t
                    always perfect. Some ATMs offer less driving comfort than

                    DSG is a VAG group specialty, used in Volkswagen vehicles.

                    Car owners love to talk about a manufacturer
                    conspiracy—intentionally understating the lifespan of
                    gearboxes. On one hand, it’s understandable. If a gearbox
                    existed that could run a million kilometers, manufacturers'
                    profits would drop significantly.
                </p>
                <p class="articles-item__paragraph articles-item__text">
                    On the other hand, the “conspiracy” could be real. These
                    days, automatic transmissions are increasingly produced with
                    claims of being maintenance-free, and the oil is filled for
                    the entire service life. But it’s not stated that the
                    assumed service life is no more than 5 years. The car owner
                    doesn’t worry, doesn’t change the oil, doesn’t service the
                    gearbox—and then BAM, it dies. And there’s no way out:
                    either rebuild it or replace it. And that costs a fortune.
                </p>
                <p class="articles-item__paragraph articles-item__text">
                    Note: maintenance-free gearboxes do not exist. It’s nothing
                    more than a clever marketing ploy. Oil must be changed in
                    any type of gearbox. Don’t forget the quality of our roads,
                    potential temperature fluctuations, and service quality.
                    Therefore, regardless of the gearbox in your car, always
                    plan on regular oil and consumable replacement. The only
                    difference is in the intervals—some more frequent, some
                    less. And if you follow these simple recommendations, you
                    can forget about any conspiracy.

                    How to extend the life of an automatic transmission

                <p class="articles-item__paragraph articles-item__text">
                    Many car owners ask how to extend the lifespan of their
                    transmission. It’s absolutely possible. Just change the oil
                    and consumables, service the gearbox on time, and monitor
                    the condition of the radiator. Speaking of the radiator: the
                    entire system depends on cooling quality. Overheating the
                    transmission equals killing it. So every 20,000 kilometers,
                    don’t be lazy—visit a service station and check the radiator
                    to keep it in proper condition. Flush it if needed and use
                    vacuum equipment.

                <p class="articles-item__paragraph articles-item__text">
                    It’s also worth mentioning the oil being used and its
                    quality. Transmission fluid is a crucial component, so it
                    must be high-quality and original. The type of oil is
                    recommended by the manufacturer and specified in the
                    technical manual. In Ukraine, it’s not always possible to
                    find the exact brand. But the oil must fully match the
                    manufacturer’s recommended composition and seasonal rating.
                    Also consider the product’s cost—cheap oil is a red flag.
                    It’s better to consult an experienced and trustworthy
                    technician.

                    While some tasks can be done yourself (e.g., checking oil
                    level and color, if the gearbox design allows), automatic
                    transmission repairs are better done in a shop environment.
                    The more reliable the specialist, the higher the chances of
                    extending the transmission’s lifespan. Any work on a CVT or
