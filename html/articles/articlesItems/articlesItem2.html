                    Transmission fluid is considered one of the most important
                    components of the automatic transmission (AT) system,
                    serving as the bonding element for the components within the
                    transmission. The oil level, its quality, and the condition
                    of the filter directly affect the functionality of the AT. A
                    low level of ATF and a clogged filter will inevitably lead
                    to breakdowns and, as a result, expensive AT repairs.
                    Poor-quality oil or its shortage reduces pressure in the
                    hydraulic circuits, which in turn leads to:

                    All the components of the AT are interconnected. If one part
                    breaks down, it quickly spreads, affecting other parts. As a
                    result, the AT can fail and become irreparable, or its
                    repair may cost more than replacing the entire unit.

                Why Does the Filter Get Clogged and Can This Be Avoided?
            </h2>
            <p class="articles-item__paragraph articles-item__text">
                Filter clogging is a natural process that occurs in any AT
                system, regardless of its type or modification. During the
                operation of the automatic transmission, its mechanical parts
                rub against each other, producing metal and plastic shavings.
                These particles enter the oil and remain in it until they
                encounter the filter. The filter allows ATF to pass through
                while trapping any debris. Thus, the filter gradually becomes
                clogged. The speed at which critical clogging occurs depends on
                the frequency of vehicle use and the temperature in the AT
                system. Nevertheless, sooner or later, the filter will clog and
                need to be replaced. If the filter is not replaced, the pressure
                from the debris will damage the filter, allowing the debris to
                enter the oil, which will then spread throughout the entire
                transmission system. The consequences will be critical.
            </p>
            <p class="articles-item__paragraph articles-item__text">
                It is impossible to prevent filter clogging, but breakdowns can
                be avoided. To do this, you need to regularly change the oil and
                filter, and also respond to the first signs of malfunction by
                visiting a service center.

            </h2>
            <p class="articles-item__paragraph articles-item__text">
                It is very difficult to visually assess the condition of the
                filter on your own, as this usually requires disassembling the
                transmission. Therefore, it is better to rely on the symptoms of
                a clogged filter:

                    does not move forward or backward;

                <li class="articles-item__list-item">
                    A jolt is felt during shifting, but there is slipping, or

                Note that these symptoms are typical of AT malfunctions and may
                indicate not only a clogged filter but also other problems.
                Therefore, at the first signs of malfunction, it is better to
                immediately visit a specialized service center for diagnostics
                and further filter replacement.

            <p class="articles-item__paragraph articles-item__text">
                Before replacing the filter, the technician determines its type.
                Depending on the type and age of the AT, it may be a coarse
                filter made of metal or plastic, a fine filter made of paper or
                synthetic material, and may also come with installed magnets
                that trap metal particles. Filters are divided into internal and
                external. Internal filters are located within the AT casing, and
                to replace them, the transmission must be removed and
                disassembled. External filters are located outside and filter
                the ATF circulating through the cooling system.

                It is important to note that if the filter is made of paper or
                synthetic materials, it is considered disposable and must be
                replaced with a new one. However, if it is metallic and there
                are no cracks or holes on its surface, the filter can be cleaned
                using special compounds and reinstalled. In any case, the work
                should be performed by professionals. We do not recommend
                performing the work yourself to avoid mistakes, even if the
                filter is located outside the AT.

            <p class="articles-item__paragraph articles-item__text">
                The filter should be replaced or cleaned every time the oil in
                the AT is changed. Without this, the replacement is meaningless,
                as dirty oil will quickly clog the filter again and require
                another filter change. It is also recommended to replace the oil
                pan gasket to avoid compromising the system's tightness.

                Which Filter is Best for Replacement?

            <p class="articles-item__paragraph articles-item__text">
                Of course, the best option for installing a filter is the
                original one. However, they are quite expensive and may not
                always be available in stores. Therefore, when choosing a
                filter, focus on the balance between price and quality. Do not
                save on this component, as a low price may indicate low quality.
                As a result, you may have to visit the service center again due
                to the rapid wear of the filter element.

            <p class="articles-item__paragraph articles-item__text">
                If you don't know which filter to buy, consult with a service
                technician. They will help you choose, based on the type of
                transmission and the manufacturer's recommendations.

                Symptoms of Low Oil Level in the AT
            </h2>
            <p class="articles-item__paragraph articles-item__text">
                Low oil in the AT is a very common problem. It occurs due to ATF
                leakage through the radiator or worn rubber seals that have
                cracked.
            </p>
            <p class="articles-item__paragraph articles-item__text">
                You can determine the oil level yourself using the dipstick that
                comes with the kit. To do this, insert the dipstick for 5
                seconds and check the level and color of the oil by placing it
                on a clean white cloth or paper. The dipstick has markings to
                provide the necessary information. Note that the oil should be
                checked only when hot.
            </p>
            <p class="articles-item__paragraph articles-item__text">
                However, not all ATs allow for self-checking of the oil. If
                there is already a critical shortage, the following symptoms
                will indicate low oil in the AT:
            </p>
            <ul class="articles-item__list">
                <li class="articles-item__list-item">
                    Decreased oil pressure, indicated by the check engine light
                    on the dashboard;
                </li>
                <li class="articles-item__list-item">
                    Jerks, knocks, or banging sounds during the operation of the
                    transmission;

                <li class="articles-item__list-item">
                    A noticeable decrease in vehicle dynamics, with an increased
                    time to accelerate;

                <li class="articles-item__list-item">

            </ul>
            <p class="articles-item__paragraph articles-item__text">
                Oil shortage will inevitably lead to oil starvation. The result
                is accelerated wear of the transmission components due to lack
                of lubrication. The metal components will rub intensely against
                each other, leading to AT failure. Therefore, we recommend
                regularly monitoring the oil level and quality.
            </p>
            <p class="articles-item__paragraph articles-item__text">
                If you can check the oil level yourself, do it at least once
                every 6 months, depending on how often the vehicle is used. It
                is recommended to change the oil every 40-60 thousand
                kilometers. If the symptoms of low oil in the AT appear earlier,
                it is important to contact specialists immediately.

            <p class="articles-item__paragraph articles-item__text">
                The difference between serviceable and non-serviceable ATs lies
                only in the frequency of maintenance. Therefore, all types of
                transmissions require oil changes. The only difference is the
                frequency. If mineral oil is used in the system, the oil change
                should occur every 30 thousand kilometers. Semi-synthetic oils
                are changed every 40-60 thousand km, while synthetic oils are
                changed every 90 thousand km.
            </p>
            <p class="articles-item__paragraph articles-item__text">
                In new ATs, the manufacturer states that the oil is filled for
                the entire service life. Note that the service life refers to no
                more than 5 years. However, even within this period, oil changes
                may be required due to improper driving practices.

                Preventing filter and oil clogging is impossible, so it is
                crucial to respond promptly to symptoms or vehicle mileage. Low
                oil levels in the AT and symptoms of a clogged filter signal the
                urgency of visiting a service center. Do not neglect this, as
                more serious breakdowns caused by oil starvation and clogged
                filters will soon follow.
            </p>
            <p class="articles-item__paragraph articles-item__text">
                We recommend regularly monitoring the oil level and quality,
                performing preventive diagnostics every 6-12 months, and
                changing the filter and transmission oil whenever necessary.
