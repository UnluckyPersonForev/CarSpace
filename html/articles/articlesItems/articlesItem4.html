                    How is the diagnosis of the automatic transmission (AT)
                    performed according to all the rules?
                </h1>
                <p class="articles-item__paragraph articles-item__text">
                    Modern automatic transmissions are very “smart” and reliable
                    mechanisms. Car owners know that driving and owning a car
                    with an AT on board is a pleasure. The unit does not require
                    adjustments or settings. It is enough to perform timely
                    maintenance, change the oil to high-quality oil, and you can
                    expect a long lifespan from the transmission. But this is
                    only possible under ideal conditions, following all
                    operational requirements, timely maintenance, and driving on
                    smooth and quality roads. Unfortunately, it is rare to find
                    such conditions. Alas, a combination of negative factors
                    leads to premature wear of parts, and repair is required. As
                    a preventive measure or to save on repair costs, it is
                    recommended to perform an AT diagnosis. This is one of the
                    most important stages of repairing a variator or automatic
                    transmission. We will discuss this procedure in detail in
                    this article.
                </p>
                <h2 class="articles-item__sub-header">How the AT works</h2>
                <p class="articles-item__paragraph articles-item__text">
                    To understand the principle and necessity of conducting
                    diagnostic work, it is desirable to know how the AT works.
                    The entire unit can be conditionally divided into three
                    parts: mechanics, hydraulics, and electronics. Hydraulics
                    transfer the torque to the mechanical part, which is
                    responsible for shifting gears. The electronics are the
                    brain of the transmission; it switches modes and provides
                    feedback to all car systems and the car owner.
                </p>
                <p class="articles-item__paragraph articles-item__text">
                    The main goal of the AT is to convert the power and torque
                    of the engine. The key element in the transmission is the
                    torque converter (or, as it is often called, the "bublik").
                    The bublik creates the coupling based on the load and wheel
                    rotation speed, but does not require active driver
                    intervention. Mechanically, the torque converter consists of
                    a pair of blade units—a centrifugal turbine and a
                    centrifugal pump—with a guiding device-reactor between them.
                </p>
                <p class="articles-item__paragraph articles-item__text">
                    The mechanical part of the AT also includes a planetary gear
                    set, which changes the gear ratio when shifting gears; a
                    brake band, and a control device. The latter includes a
                    hydraulic block (valve plate), consisting of a large system
                    of channels, oil reservoir, valves, and plungers. Their main
                    task is to control the system, convert the engine load,
                    pedal pressure, and vehicle speed into hydraulic signals.
                    These signals then change the gear ratios.

                    Knowing how the transmission works, some preventive work can
                    be done independently, avoiding maintenance costs at the
                    service station. But everything depends on the type of
                    breakdown. And here, it gets quite tricky, since there are
                    many AT malfunctions, and their symptoms are very similar.

                    smells, and noticeable vibrations when starting or driving.
                    In all these cases, a diagnosis is needed.

                    The complexity of diagnosing the AT lies in the fact that
                    the same symptom can indicate different faults. Sometimes,
                    to determine the malfunction, a visual inspection of the
                    transmission is enough, while other times, it needs to be
                    fully disassembled. In both cases, the symptom remains the
                    same.

                    One of the advantages of the automatic transmission is that
                    when malfunctions occur in the electronic part, the unit
                    detects it and switches the systems into emergency mode.
                    First, the car owner is notified. Second, the transmission
                    automatically activates special operating systems that help
                    the unit continue to perform its functions. At this point,
                    the transmission only partially works (often, the AT only
                    shifts into 3rd gear), but this is enough for the car to
                    drive to the service station.

                    Very often, one malfunction leads to another if it is not
                    addressed in time. The principle of AT operation is similar
                    to a snowball, as everything in the transmission is
                    interconnected. For example, if friction disks wear out,
                    they gradually contaminate the oil. The oil, circulating
                    through the hydraulic block, leaves traces of the worn
                    friction disks, which leads to the failure of the plates.
                    This leads to a critical overheating of the AT and its
                    complete failure. Therefore, it is crucial to perform
                    diagnostics and address faults at the early stages.

                    If leaks were noticed on the pan during the initial

                    the fluid for impurities, their quantity, color, and
                    consistency. ATF should be yellowish or reddish in color,

                    Transmission diagnostics are necessary in any case: whether
                    buying a car, performing preventive maintenance, or
                    identifying a failure. The more accurate and high-quality
                    the diagnostics, the lower the repair costs will be later.
                    Proper diagnostics by a professional can accurately identify
                    the fault and work on just that. It is also essential to
                    diagnose the transmission in different modes.

                    In general, transmission diagnostics can be performed
                    independently. However, considering the low cost of the
                    service, self-diagnostics will take a lot of time and
                    effort. Moreover, it will not provide a 100% guarantee of an
                    accurate result, as it will always be done under makeshift
                    conditions and by a person who is not sufficiently
                    competent.

                    Ideally, diagnostic work, and especially transmission
                    repairs, should be performed by a qualified technician in a
                    designated work facility. Only in such conditions can you
                    expect a complete result from the diagnostics.
