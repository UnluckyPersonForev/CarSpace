                    The eternal dilemma for car owners: when to change the oil
                    in the automatic transmission (AT) – is it necessary, or is
                    it better to leave everything as is? Some people randomly
                    flip through the transmission manual in search of the
                    manufacturer's words “for the entire lifespan,” while others
                    are convinced that the oil in the AT should be changed every
                    10-15 thousand kilometers. What’s the truth? In this
                    article, we’ll thoroughly examine the issue of replacing the
                    working ATF in an automatic, clearing up all
                    misunderstandings.

                    ATF (Automatic Transmission Fluid) affects several

                    replacement is recommended every 50-60k km with standard
                    vehicle use. In continuously variable transmissions (CVT),
                    ATF should be replaced no less than every 50,000 km. Robotic
                    gearboxes require oil changes every 60-80k km. DSG and
                    Powershift transmissions (though they lack a torque
                    converter) recommend a replacement interval of 50-60k km,

                    period. If the driving style is aggressive (drifting), the
                    car often drives on dirt roads or off-road, carries heavy
                    loads, tows a trailer, idles frequently in traffic, the oil
                    change intervals mentioned above should be reduced by at
                    least 30%. The same applies when the vehicle is used in
                    extreme heat or cold or is driven at its limits, for
                    instance, during racing or by a car owner who loves
                    high-speed driving for extended periods.

                    Oil problems (poor quality, loss of lubrication properties,
                    low or excess oil levels) always manifest in transmission
                    malfunctions, and as a result, in vehicle performance. The
                    car often starts jerking, loses driving dynamics,
                    experiences delays when shifting gears, or one of the gears
                    may completely disengage. These symptoms indicate that the
                    problem has worsened, and an oil change is necessary. It’s
                    important to visit a specialized transmission repair service
                    and conduct a diagnostic analysis of the transmission
                    components.

                    Specific cases for ATF replacement in certain car brands
                </h2>
                <p class="articles-item__paragraph articles-item__text">
                    Most cars within a similar price range with classic ATs
                    require oil replacement at the traditional intervals of
                    30-60k km, depending on the load on the unit. Toyota cars
                    manufactured before 1999 fall into this category. However,
                    newer Toyota cars require special attention. The thing is,
                    modern vehicles with updated transmission models use a new
                    generation of oil – Toyota Genuine ATF WS or Toyota Genuine
                    ATF type T-IV, which should be replaced no more often than
                    every 90,000 km, even under heavy loads. If the vehicle is
                    used in normal conditions without excessive stress, the car
                    owner only needs to check the oil condition periodically or
                    decide to change it based on certain circumstances, such as
                    overheating the transmission or the car driving with cold
                    oil several times.

                    How to change the oil in the AT?
                </h2>
                <p class="articles-item__paragraph articles-item__text">
                    Most of the time, oil replacement refers to a partial drain
                    of the used oil and dilution of the remaining fluid with
                    fresh oil. In reality, an unknown amount of dirty oil
                    remains in the torque converter and is mixed with an unknown
                    amount of fresh fluid. The oil is mixed, but even with
                    partial replacement in the AT, it is not in an ideal
                    condition. It’s worth pointing out that partial ATF
                    replacement is profitable for service centers. Since the
                    work isn’t cheap (nor is the oil), it is recommended every
                    30-60k km, yet it results in a questionable outcome.
                    However, this method remains popular and relevant, as it is
                    still more cost-effective than a full ATF replacement.

                    Full replacement of the automatic transmission fluid (ATF)
                    is the second method, which is more effective and efficient.
                    It involves completely displacing the old, used oil using a
                    special device and filling it with fresh fluid. At the same
                    time, the filter, pan, or pan gasket is also replaced. The
                    answer to the question "Which is better, a full or partial
                    oil change in the ATF?" is obvious. A full fluid replacement
                    is better and provides 100% efficiency.

                    However, not all vehicles are allowed to use this method.
                    For example, in some Honda models, the pan is non-removable,
                    which excludes the possibility of fully replacing the fluid.
                    To do this, the pan must be drilled out, and then a new one
                    must be purchased and installed, which is not rational.

                <p class="articles-item__paragraph articles-item__text">
                    20 years ago, to preserve the technical properties of the
                    oil, all automakers, as if by copy, recommended changing the
                    oil after a certain mileage interval. But with the
                    development of technology, manufacturers managed to achieve
                    the effect of adapting the automatic transmission to loads,
                    driving style, and ATF characteristics. And then, leading
                    manufacturers, such as Mercedes, Audi, and BMW, made a
                    breakthrough – they stated that there is no need to replace
                    the oil in the transmission. The label "for the full service
                    life" appeared on the five-speed transmission series 722.6,
                    and a little later, on all ZF-type gearboxes. However,
                    Mercedes and BMW manufacturers, in small print, noted that
                    in harsh driving conditions, oil replacement is necessary.
                    In a short time, this trend was adopted by all automakers,
                    significantly increasing the interval for changing the
                    working fluid. The result can be seen by comparing the
                    technical characteristics of modern transmissions with those
                    of components installed in cars at the end of the 20th
                    century.

                <p class="articles-item__paragraph articles-item__text">
                    Now, all manufacturers, even the leaders, indicate the
                    mileage interval for oil changes. For example, Mercedes
                    recommends changing the oil in the 722.6 transmission (which
                    started the non-replaceable oil trend) every 50,000 km or
                    once every three years. The most advanced versions of the
                    transmission – the seven-speed 722.9 models – require
                    replacement every 125,000 km or every 5 years.

                    European manufacturers often continue to state that the ATF
                    is filled for the full service life of the vehicle. But
                    there is an important nuance here. Automakers assume that
                    the vehicle will be in service for no more than 5-6 years,
                    after which it will be replaced with a new one. In our
                    realities, cars are often purchased for a much longer
                    period. This implies a sharp need to replace the oil every 5
                    years, provided the vehicle is used under standard
                    conditions without excessive stress. It is worth noting that
                    each oil change requires replacing the filter.

                    smell indicate that the oil has lost its lubricating
                    properties, which has led to increased friction of metal

                    product is of better quality than what was initially filled
                    by the manufacturer. After all, the manufacturer's primary
