                    10 Most Popular Myths About Automatic Transmissions
                </h1>
                <p class="articles-item__paragraph articles-item__text">
                    Despite the wide variety of automatic transmission types,
                    cars with manual transmissions continue to be bought. And
                    not in small numbers. Undoubtedly, a car with a manual
                    transmission has its charm (especially after watching "The
                    Fast and the Furious" :-) ), some people love to feel the
                    gears and control them entirely by themselves. But we know
                    that some car owners are reluctant to switch from manual to
                    automatic simply because they believe in myths about the
                    latter. The internet is full of unfortunate information
                    about automatic transmissions. Who writes it is unknown.
                    Perhaps manual transmission enthusiasts. But we are here to
                    dispel the most popular myths. Let's go!
                </p>

                <h2 class="articles-item__sub-header">
                    Cars with automatic transmissions are very fuel-hungry
                </h2>
                <p class="articles-item__paragraph articles-item__text">
                    This statement cannot be called a myth. At least because, to
                    compare fuel consumption, you need to compare two cars with
                    the same technical characteristics and driving style.
                </p>
                <p class="articles-item__paragraph articles-item__text">
                    First of all, the term "automatic" can refer to a specific
                    type of transmission. This includes CVTs, robots, and
                    classic automatics with a hydraulic torque converter
                    onboard. Each variation has its own technical nuances and,
                    accordingly, its own fuel consumption. For example, a robot
                    is essentially a regular manual with added control modules
                    that engage the clutch.
                </p>
                <p class="articles-item__paragraph articles-item__text">
                    Secondly, some people consistently drive at 60 km/h, while
                    others race from one traffic light to the next. In this
                    case, the type of transmission doesn't matter. Logically,
                    when driving slowly and smoothly, fuel consumption will be
                    lower.
                </p>
                <p class="articles-item__paragraph articles-item__text">
                    Maybe the whole point is that manual transmissions are
                    usually found in more economical classes of cars? And in
                    that case, comparing fuel consumption is pointless because
                    you need to compare engine power.
                </p>
                <p class="articles-item__paragraph articles-item__text">
                    Anyway, there's a popular opinion that automatic
                    transmissions consume 10% more fuel than manual ones. We
                    won't argue; in some situations, that's true. But sometimes,
                    fuel consumption with a manual transmission is identical.
                </p>
                <h2 class="articles-item__sub-header">
                    Manual transmissions provide better acceleration
                </h2>
                <p class="articles-item__paragraph articles-item__text">
                    The driver's experience is very important. If a professional
                    is behind the wheel and can shift gears quickly, the myth is
                    quite justified. But such drivers are few and far between on
                    the road.
                </p>
                <p class="articles-item__paragraph articles-item__text">
                    Fact: Modern automatic transmissions can shift gears in less
                    than a second. Now, let's compare. What are the odds that a
                    driver can depress the clutch, disengage one gear, and
                    engage another in less than one second? Practically zero.
                    Therefore, in 9 out of 10 cases, a car with an automatic
                    transmission will outperform a manual transmission in
                    acceleration.
                </p>
                <h2 class="articles-item__sub-header">
                    Automatic transmissions are unreliable
                </h2>
                <p class="articles-item__paragraph articles-item__text">
                    Would a manual transmission be reliable if driven off-road,
                    through mud, drifting, and completely violating the rules of
                    operation? Doubtful. Claims about the unreliability of
                    automatic transmissions are a myth. Because it's all
                    relative. Someone might drive an off-road vehicle through
                    snow or swamp and kill the automatic transmission after just
                    1 km. Yet, someone else might drive for 200,000 km, and the
                    transmission is still fine. Proper maintenance of the
                    transmission and timely servicing play a huge role. Without
                    this, no transmission will survive.
                </p>
                <h2 class="articles-item__sub-header">
                    Automatic transmissions are useless in winter
                </h2>
                <p class="articles-item__paragraph articles-item__text">
                    There is some truth to this. Because in winter, it's harder
                    to get a car with an automatic transmission moving by
                    switching back and forth.
                </p>
                <p class="articles-item__paragraph articles-item__text">
                    However, most modern automatic transmissions have a winter
                    mode, which helps the car move more easily on icy roads.
                    It's also important to note that in a car with an automatic
                    transmission, the gear is always engaged, unlike a manual
                    transmission, where you often coast in neutral at a
                    stoplight or when shifting gears slowly. Those who know what
                    I'm talking about will understand how important continuous
                    wheel momentum is.

                <h2 class="articles-item__sub-header">
                    You can't tow a car with an automatic transmission. Only a
                    tow truck

                <p class="articles-item__paragraph articles-item__text">
                    There is a belief that if you tow a car with an automatic
                    transmission, some of its parts will break. This belief is
                    somewhat debatable but partly true.
                </p>
                <p class="articles-item__paragraph articles-item__text">
                    The transmission needs hydraulic pressure, which is created
                    by the pump in tandem with the engine. Without this, the
                    transmission components cannot function. This means the risk
                    of damaging the clutch during towing is minimal. However,
                    the pump also helps circulate the oil through all the
                    components. If it fails during towing, important components
                    are likely to break.
                </p>
                <p class="articles-item__paragraph articles-item__text">
                    However, if you can lift the drive axle off the ground,
                    towing will proceed without problems. The transmission won’t
                    even realize it was towed. Also, before towing, check the

                    adding fluid to the automatic transmission before towing and
                    sticking to a certain speed to minimize risks. Note that
                    some automakers say you shouldn’t tow the car, in which
                    case, a tow truck is indeed the best option.

                    Still think that when stopping at a traffic light, you must
                    switch to neutral to avoid quickly wearing out the clutch?
                    This is no more than a myth. Perhaps early automatic
                    transmissions required this, but modern units are smart
                    enough. In fact, the automatic transmission doesn’t
                    understand that there is a red light in front of you – it
                    works within a limited set of actions. However, there is a
                    connection between the brake pedal and the transmission. It
                    knows when the brake pedal is pressed and can automatically
                    switch to neutral without additional lever movements.

                    when staying in Drive mode while braking at traffic lights

                    For some unclear reason, there is a belief that the oil pump
                    operates from the output of the torque converter (TCC).
                    However, in reality, the oil pump drive is connected to the
                    body of the TCC. Therefore, pressure is generated in the
                    system as soon as the engine starts to rotate. Oil
                    circulates in the system in all modes, and starvation is

                    transmissions produced last century when the torque
                    converter lacked a locking function. Now, any automatic
                    transmission, even those without an ECU, are produced with a
                    self-locking torque converter. In this mode, the stator of
                    the torque converter and the rotor are connected through a
                    friction clutch. The moment from the engine is transferred
                    to the planetary gears of the automatic transmission,
                    bypassing the hydraulic transmission. This significantly
                    increases the efficiency of the transmission.

                    Changing the oil in the automatic transmission is indeed
                    necessary but is required rarely. Some manufacturers even
                    specify that the oil is meant to last the entire service

                    taxi services, or participation in races. If the operating
                    rules are followed, the transmission fluid may not need to
                    be changed until 60,000 or even 80,000 kilometers, depending
