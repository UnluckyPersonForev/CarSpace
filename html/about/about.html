                            Before any repair begins, automatic transmission
                            diagnostics are performed. This is a mandatory and
                            essential part of the service process. Transmission
                            diagnostics help determine the overall condition of
                            the gearbox, the quality, color, and consistency of
                            the oil, the condition of components critical to the
                            transmission's operation, as well as identify the
                            type and cause of the malfunction. Diagnostic work
                            starts with a test drive to identify any symptoms of
                            failure, followed by a visual inspection of external
                            components (such as the transmission pan and the
                            presence of metal shavings inside it). If the issue
                            is internal, the technician removes the transmission
                            and performs a teardown (defect analysis). During
                            this process, all transmission components are
                            inspected for integrity and potential damage. Only
                            after diagnostics are completed can the malfunction
                            and the appropriate method of repair be determined.

                            The first stage of transmission repair is vehicle
                            intake and diagnostics. This is carried out in
                            several steps: test drive, visual inspection,
                            computer diagnostics, and defect analysis (optional,
                            if needed). After diagnostics, once the issue is
                            identified and the repair timeline and cost are
                            approved by the client, the technician proceeds with
                            the service. The transmission is removed in
                            accordance with the vehicle manufacturer's technical
                            guidelines. Components are cleaned with a special
                            solution, and the cooling system is flushed. Repairs
                            are carried out with replacement of parts (if
                            necessary) or restoration of existing ones.
                            Transmission fluid and filters are replaced if
                            required. The transmission is then reassembled and
                            reinstalled. Finally, transmission adaptation is
                            performed, followed by a final test drive to ensure
                            the issue has been resolved and to assess all key
                            performance indicators of the system.

                                    efficiently. They scheduled my appointment
                                    precisely. They explained what they would
                                    do, and showed me everything. I really
                                    appreciated that while servicing my car, the
                                    guys also checked the overall condition of
                                    the vehicle - looking for leaks, checking
                                    the condition of the dust boots, etc... I'm
                                    very satisfied with their work - you can
                                    clearly see they're genuinely happy to help.
                                    That's really valuable these days. I highly
                                    recommend them.

                                    I had my automatic transmission repaired at

                                    On my friends’ recommendation, I brought my
                                    car here for automatic transmission repair.
                                    The service and repairs were excellent. What
                                    I really liked was how they explained
                                    everything in detail — why a specific
                                    approach was needed, which made the process
                                    clear and stress-free. The car runs
                                    perfectly now, with no transmission issues
                                    whatsoever. I can recommend this auto
                                    service center.
